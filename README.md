# MesaBusProtocol
Flexible Byte transport protocol for bus bridging CPUs to FPGAs over UART,SPI,SERDES physical interfaces

Mesa Bus Protocol is intended to transfer data between 50 Kbps up to 10 Gbps over UART to SERDES links with just a few wires and very little hardware overhead. It is a very small gate foot print byte transport protocol for encapsulating and transferring payloads of higher protocols (0-255 bytes per payload). Think of it like a cross between Ethernet and USB 3.1. The advantages Mesa Bus Protocol has over USB, Ethernet and PCI is that it fits easily within a $3 FPGA and may be bus mastered either by a PC with a FTDI cable or any old ARM/AVR Arduino CPU (or RPi) with just two standard UART serial port pins. As it is ASCII based, Mesa Bus Protocol is also very portable to wireless devices such as Bluetooth SPP and the RockBLOCK satellite modem for the Iridium network . MBP supports daisy chaining of up to 250 devices, allowing a single CPU bus master to communicate ( with latency ) to multiple FPGAs using a single serial interface.
